# BERT-Fine Tuning

Emotion Classification with BERT and LoRA

This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for emotion classification. We leverage the powerful pre-trained bert-base-uncased model and apply the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique to efficiently adapt it to a new dataset, specifically the SetFit/emotion dataset.
